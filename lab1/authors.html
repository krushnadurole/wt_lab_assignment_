                    <td>Dame Agatha Mary Clarissa Christie, Lady Mallowan, DBE (née Miller; 15 September 1890
                        12 January 1976) was an English writer known for her 66 detective novels and 14 short story

                        She also wrote the world's longest-running play, the murder mystery The Mousetrap, which has
                        been
                        performed in the West End since 1952. A writer during the "Golden Age of Detective Fiction",
                        Christie has been called the "Queen of Crime". She also wrote six novels under the pseudonym
                        Mary Westmacott. In 1971, she was made a Dame (DBE) by Queen Elizabeth II for her
                        contributions to literature. Guinness World Records lists Christie as the best-selling

                    <td>Sir Ahmed Salman Rushdie CH FRSL ( born 19 June 1947) is an Indian-born
                        British-American novelist.[3] His work often combines magic realism with historical fiction and
                        primarily deals with connections, disruptions, and migrations between Eastern and Western
                        civilizations,
                        typically set on the Indian subcontinent.Rushdie was born in India, but was sent to England to
                        go to private school.
                        He has lived in the United States since 2000. Rushdie is well known for writing stories which
                        use "magic realism",
                        which is similar to surrealism. This means that things in his stories happen which may be magic
                        or impossible,
                        such as falling from an aeroplane and floating down as gently as paper.[2] He often writes about
                        India, and his
                        stories often are set in different parts of the world.</td>
